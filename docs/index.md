# Welcome to LanceDB's Documentation

LanceDB is an open-source database for vector-search built with persistent storage, which greatly simplifies retrevial, filtering and management of embeddings.

The key features of LanceDB include:

* Production-scale vector search with no servers to manage.

* Combine attribute-based information with vectors and store them as a single source-of-truth.

* Zero-copy, automatic versioning, manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.

* Ecosystem integrations: Apache-Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB and more on the way.

LanceDB's core is written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and is built using Lance, an open-source columnar format designed for performant ML workloads.
